# Project Title
Node.js SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Server

## Project Description
A lightweight SMTP server designed to receive, process, and log incoming email streams. Deployed on AWS EC2 and routed via Cloudflare.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand and implement the mechanism behind electronic mail transmission. By implementing a custom SMTP server, we aim to understand about DNS servers, Node.js, SMTP ports and the usage of AWS EC2 instances & Cloudflare DNS routing.

## Hosted URL
This is a backend SMTP server and cannot be accessed via a web browser. To test the server, send an email to any address at this domain:  
address@palksh.me

This is the email address of the custom domain names purchased from Namecheap.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend
N/A (Backend-only application)

### Backend
- Listens for inbound SMTP traffic on TCP port 25.
- Captures and logs sender (onMailFrom) and recipient (onRcptTo) metadata.
- Processes raw email data streams and outputs them directly to the console.
- Executes via standard Node.js runtime attached to the active terminal session.
